## Bash visualization

Embedded-shell calls default to Python-like **Pseudo**; switch to **Raw** for the original command. Syntax appears incrementally as the shell compiles it. Active commands retain their colors while inactive code fades; only failures get `×`. Values appear beside each variable's latest observed setter.

In Tern, the toggle and menu stay in the command segment; replay controls live in the inspector. In the inspector, `v` toggles Raw/Pseudo; `c/i/d/e/u` toggle color, inline variables, idioms, effects and embedded programs; `s` splits original/Pseudo. Space plays or pauses retained execution, arrows step, `r` resets, `l` returns live, and `−/+` changes speed. Escape closes.

Replay retains up to 20,000 records, 2 MiB output and 8 MiB payload; evictions are indicated. Effect badges are heuristic, not safety guarantees. Remote-script interiors are marked untraced; PTY/user-shell calls keep their plain command view.

## Graceful restart

`omp restart` queues a drain and checkpoints the exact session before replacing
the running process with `process.execve` (supported by Bun on Linux). The PID,
foreground terminal and shell exit status are preserved; no supervisor or old
session heap remains. Platforms without `process.execve` cannot restart this way.
The lead finishes its current model response and tool batch before checkpointing;
its in-flight model call is never aborted. While waiting, the CLI reports that it
is waiting for the lead's turn to finish. `OMP_RESTART_ROOT_QUIESCENCE_MS` sets the
root wait bound in milliseconds (default `600000`, ten minutes). On expiry the
request stays queued and restarts at the next safe boundary. Use
`omp restart cancel --instance <id>` to cancel it. Child worker grace is unchanged.

A replacement startup failure returns to the shell; resume the saved checkpoint
with `omp --resume <session-file>`.

Installing this fix does not change already-running code. A pre-fix runtime can
hand off once to the new build, but its existing waiting ancestors remain until
the active session exits. To reclaim those heaps without signaling any process,
exit the active session normally, wait for the shell prompt, then launch
`omp --resume <session-file>` from that shell. Subsequent restarts replace in place.


## Memory backends

The agent supports three mutually-exclusive memory backends, selected via the `memory.backend` setting (Settings → Memory tab, or `~/.omp/config.yml`):

- `off` (default) — no memory subsystem runs.
- `local` — existing rollout-summarisation pipeline; writes `memory_summary.md` and consolidated artifacts under the agent dir.
- `hindsight` — talks to a [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) server (Cloud or self-hosted Docker), retains transcripts every Nth user turn, recalls memories on the first turn of a session, and exposes `retain`, `recall`, and `reflect`.

### Hindsight quickstart

1. Run a Hindsight server (Cloud or `docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest`).
2. Set `memory.backend = "hindsight"` and `hindsight.apiUrl = "http://localhost:8888"` (or your Cloud URL).
3. Optional environment overrides (env wins over settings):
   - `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` — connection
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` — bank addressing
   - `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL`, `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN`, `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` — lifecycle
   - `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET`, `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` — recall sizing
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION`, `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG`

Switching backends mid-session immediately replaces the live backend, memory tools, listeners, and system-prompt context. Existing users with `memories.enabled = true|false` are migrated to `memory.backend = "local"|"off"` exactly once on first launch; afterward, `memory.backend` is the sole runtime selector.
